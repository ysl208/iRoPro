# iRoPro - interactive Robot Programming tool

iRoPro is an interactive Robot Programming tool, currently developed for the Baxter robot.
The goal of the system is to provide an easy way to program low- and high-level manipulation actions that can be used with a task planner to complete more complex tasks.
It is based on [Rapid PbD](https://github.com/jstnhuang/rapid_pbd/) which is a programming by demonstration (PbD) system for the PR2, Fetch, and Baxter robots.

## Program model
Users use the iRoPro interface to create *actions* and *problems*.
A video of the working system can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/NgaTPG8dZwg)
